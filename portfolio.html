     <h1>  1.1.9 Project: Build a Soda </h1>

        <img width ="300" height="302" src="https://github.com/YaliniR/Website/blob/main/fullcup.PNG?raw=true">
        <p>For my first project, I created a program for a game along with my group that would allow users to choose a soda through user input. The user could choose sodas like Sprite, Dr.Pepper, and Coke, and once the user types in what soda they want, a cup will be drawn under the correct soda. Then, a stream of soda will be drawn, and the cup will be filled up with the soda.</p>

    <h1> 1.2.5 Project: Star Catchers </h1>
      <img src="https://github.com/YaliniR/Website/blob/main/catch%20a%20star%20picture.png?raw=true">
      <p>For this project, my group decided to make a game where players could gain points by "catching" stars. There is a blue box on the screen that can be controlled with the left and right arrow keys, and the star can be dropped into the box if the corresponding number key is pressed. Once the star is dropped into the box, the player will earn points according to what point value is printed on the star. The goal is to earn as many points before the 30 second timer runs out!</p>

    <h1> 1.3.1 Project: E-Card </h1>
      <img width= "300" src="https://github.com/YaliniR/Website/blob/main/1.3.1%20project%20picture.PNG?raw=true" >
	<p> For the e-card project, my group and I chose to design a card for a children's hospital, and we centered our theme around dogs and funny jokes. The intro starts off with an image of a dog holding a card becoming larger and larger and then, a card pops out to ask the user if they would like to hear a joke. By pressing the right keys, the user will be able to see the answer of the joke and then see a new joke pop up on their screen as many times as they want. The greeting card closes at the end when the user doesn't want to see any more jokes, and it slides off the screen; we then made turtle print "Get Well Soon!" at the very end. </p>

    <h1> 2.1.6 Project: Fish Tank </h1>

    <img src="https://github.com/YaliniR/Website/blob/main/pic%202.PNG?raw=true" height="300">
	<p>For this project, my group analyzed multiple files and different software programs in order to figure out how to make the programs properly analyze the concentrations of different elements in a fish tank. We went through each file and fixed the mistakes, such as incorrect index values, in order to have a fully working fish tank program.</p>

    <h1>  Scratch Program </h1>
      <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1096099653/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	    <p> For our scratch program, my group decided to code a game inspired by the Minion Rush game. We added in "potions" as obstacles for the minion to jump over (using the spacebar), and the game has multiple backgrounds. We also used multiple costumes,sound, animations, events, a score variable, and input factors in our game.</p>


<h1> 2.2.7 Project </h1>
	     <img src= "https://github.com/YaliniR/Website/blob/main/2.2.7.PNG?raw=true"  height="300">
	    <p> For this project, my group and I created a GUI that allows users to check the data of the website like the availability, the activation status, and the receive status of the website. We decorated it to make it easier to view as well as more visually appealing. </p>
	    
<h1> 3.1.6 Project</h1>
	    <img src= "https://github.com/YaliniR/Website/blob/main/inland%20forest.jpeg?raw=true" height= "300" >
	    <p> By sorting through and organizing the given data, my team concluded that the rover would have been in an inland forest. The temperature is constant with slight variations, there is constant ambient light throughout the day, and the gyroscope constantly changes between a positive and negative angle meaning it could be traveling through an uneven terrain. Because of these conclusions, the most likely environment would be an inland forest.
