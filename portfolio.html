     <h1>  1.1.9 Project: Build a Soda </h1>

        <p>For my first project, I created a program for a game along with my group that would allow users to choose a soda through user input. The user could choose sodas like Sprite, Dr.Pepper, and Coke, and once the user types in what soda they want, a cup will be drawn under the correct soda. Then, a stream of soda will be drawn, and the cup will be filled up with the soda.</p>

    <h1> 1.2.5 Project: Star Catchers </h1>
      <img src="https://github.com/YaliniR/Website/blob/main/catch%20a%20star%20picture.png?raw=true">
      <p>For this project, my group decided to make a game where players could gain points by "catching" stars. There is a blue box on the screen that can be controlled with the left and right arrow keys, and the star can be dropped into the box if the corresponding number key is pressed. Once the star is dropped into the box, the player will earn points according to what point value is printed on the star. The goal is to earn as many points before the 30 second timer runs out!</p>

    <h1> 1.3.1 Project: E-Card </h1>
      <img width= "300" src="https://github.com/YaliniR/Website/blob/main/1.3.1%20project%20picture.PNG?raw=true" >
	<p> For the e-card project, my group and I chose to design a card for a children's hospital, and we centered our theme around dogs and funny jokes. The intro starts off with an image of a dog holding a card becoming larger and larger and then, a card pops out to ask the user if they would like to hear a joke. By pressing the right keys, the user will be able to see the answer of the joke and then see a new joke pop up on their screen as many times as they want. The greeting card closes at the end when the user doesn't want to see any more jokes, and it slides off the screen; we then made turtle print "Get Well Soon!" at the very end. </p>
